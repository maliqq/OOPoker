/*
Combination:
Represents a combination of 5 cards, forming things like a pair, a flush, etc..
This file also has functions for checking which combination is formed by 5 or by 7 cards.

This contains a naive and slow 7-card hand evaluator, but has the advantage that
these functions can be used to check what combination a player has and to convert it to a name,
and to check which 5 cards are involved.

If you need to evaluate many of hands for combinations for a poker AI, then don't use
the functions from this file. Use eval7 from pokermath.h instead: that one can evaluate
millions of hands per second.
