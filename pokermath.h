/*
The getPotEquity returns a value in the range 0.0-1.0 representing roughly how much win chance you have to win the pot,
depending on your hand cards and the known cards on the table. The opponents hands and unknown table cards can be ANY cards.
More precicely, it returns the percentage of money you'd win from the pot when you would be in this situation (=
these hand cards, these known table cards, and this amount of opponents) lots and lots of times. Sometimes you'll win,
sometimes you'll lose, in the end after so many plays you'll win that percentage of the pot.

If you want win, tie and lose chance instead of equity, use the getWinChance... functions below instead.

Getting pot equity is a type of poker math function that takes a long time to calculate and can be implemented
in many different ways with many different strategies (a combination of exhaustive search, monte carlo statistical
simulation, lookup tables and combinatorics). This one from OOPoker is just one possible implementation, and may be
changed or improved over time to become more accurate and more efficient. Its speed, accuracy and randomness
might change in future implementations.

Some inspiration for writing this function was gotten from:
http://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/multiway-ranged-isometric-equity-calculation-in-poker-1
http://www.pokerstove.com/

Parameters:
holeCards: vector must have size 2, represents your two hand cards
boardCards: vector must have size 0, 3, 4 or 5 (pre-flop, flop, turn, river), represents the known board cards
numOpponents: number of active opponents
numSamples: used when this function will use many samples to simulate many possible hand combinations. The higher the value, the more accurate the result, but the slower the function. 50000 is a good value.

/*
This calculates the win chance of multiple players, all of which have known cards. This is useful
at pre-flop, flop or turn. At river there is no unknown factor anymore (but the function will still
return the correct result).

Parameters:
win, tie and lose: this are std::vectors that will have the same size as the number of players and contain the chances of each player.
holeCards1, holeCards2: the hand cards of all players. The size of these vectors must be the same and indicates the amount of players.
boardCards: 0 to 5 cards on the table.
numSamples: used when this function will use many samples to simulate many possible hand combinations. The higher the value, the more accurate the result, but the slower the function. 50000 is a good value.

returns false if error happened (such as invalid parameters)
